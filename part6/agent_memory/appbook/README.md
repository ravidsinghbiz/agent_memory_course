# The Agent Memory Stack — App

A FastAPI + vanilla-JS application that turns the
[`agent_memory_zero_to_hero.ipynb`](../agent_memory_zero_to_hero.ipynb) workshop into an
interactive, sleek (light/dark) web app. The sidebar is the **memory stack**: each layer adds
one capability, climbing from a single conversation to a coordinating multi-agent team, then
combining the complete stack in an observable final lab. It is
powered by **MemoRizz 0.6** on **Oracle AI Database** with an exact-search
filesystem fallback.

| # | Memory layer | Page | What it shows |
|---|--------------|------|----------------|
| 1 | **Conversation** | `#/conversation` | Episodic `CONVERSATION_MEMORY`; remembers across turns and across a restart (`MemAgent.load`). |
| 2 | **Persona & Entities** | `#/semantic` | Semantic memory: a stable `PERSONAS` identity + structured `ENTITY_MEMORY` facts. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Base** | `#/knowledge` | RAG over a `KnowledgeBase` (vector search) + a grounded, cited answer. |
| 4 | **Procedural** | `#/procedural` | Tools + a recalled `WORKFLOW_MEMORY` runbook + first-class, lifecycle-aware `SKILLBOX` retrieval. |
| 5 | **Coordination** | `#/coordination` | `SHARED_MEMORY`: a lead + Researcher + Reviewer collaborating, via `MultiAgentOrchestrator`. |
| 6 | **Complete Stack** | `#/unified` | One chat with exact model-context capture plus standalone semantic-cache, summarization, and compaction units. It exposes all 13 `MemoryType` partitions, cache hits, summary/source IDs, and offloaded `TOOL_LOG` pointers. |

Stage 6 is split into four focused units while retaining one scoped MemoRizz
session:

- **6.1 Unified Chat** captures the literal `messages` and `tools` payload sent
  on every model iteration and maps each memory partition to `in context`,
  `stored`, `runtime`, or `served turn`.
- **6.2 Semantic Cache** runs the same fingerprint-stable request twice and
  proves the second response skipped the model with
  `semantic_cache_stats()` and `inspect_semantic_cache()` evidence.
- **6.3 Summarization** calls `MemAgent.generate_summaries()` and displays each
  generated summary ID, content, and exact `source_message_ids`.
- **6.4 Compaction** shows the durable source rows linked to a summary and the
  smaller effective context that results. Large deterministic diagnostic tool
  output is independently offloaded through `ToolResultPolicy` and remains
  expandable by its `tool_log_id`.

A prominent **Memory Data Explorer** panel on the overview opens the persistent,
resizable explorer that sits at the bottom of every page. It
browses the MemoRizz-owned tables in the active `MEMORIZZ` schema, shows real
columns, primary keys and paginated rows, summarizes VECTOR and large LOB cells,
and highlights memory reads and writes through a live SSE activity rail. Oracle's
generated index backing tables are excluded, and the browser surface is strictly
read-only. With the filesystem fallback, the same UI exposes virtual tables for
the current `MemoryType` stores.

## Run

```bash
# from this directory
./run.sh
# → http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

`run.sh` activates the **`oracle_demos`** conda env if present, installs the requirements on
first run, and starts uvicorn. Or manually:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000   # run from appbook/
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In a Codespace, open the app from the Ports panel → 🌐 Open in Browser.** Confirm it's up with
> `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health` (`200` = up).

## Requirements & graceful degradation

- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** — required for generated answers (the LLM `gpt-5.6-luna` **and** the embeddings
  `text-embedding-3-small` @ 256d). Read from `appbook/.env`, or the
  course's existing `../.env` / `../../.env`. Without it, health and retrieval
  still initialize on Oracle (or the filesystem fallback) with a deterministic
  teaching embedder, while model-backed routes return a clear error.
- **Oracle AI Database** — optional. Run
  `../../ai_maturity_form_factors/oracle.sh start` to provision the dedicated
  256-dimensional `MEMORIZZ` schema, then copy `.env.example` to `.env`. The app
  builds a MemoRizz `OracleProvider` and auto-creates its memory stores. If
  Oracle is unset or unreachable it falls back to MemoRizz's
  **`FileSystemProvider`** under `appbook/.data/memorizz`, so the whole app still runs. The
  active backend is shown in the sidebar and on each page.

Every request-serving memory operation supplies host-owned `memory_id`,
`user_id`, and `thread_id` values. The app also uses `.with_model(...)`,
`memory_capabilities()`, a first-class `Skillbox`, governed cache-compatible
model configuration, and typed provider capability reporting from MemoRizz 0.6.

## Architecture

```

├── backend/
│   ├── main.py              FastAPI app; warms the Memory Core; serves the SPA
│   ├── config.py            env loading, model, embeddings, Oracle creds
│   ├── schemas.py           Pydantic request bodies

│   │   ├── memory.py        the Memory Core: memorizz provider (Oracle→filesystem) + helpers

└── frontend/                index.html · styles.css · app.js (no build step)
```

Every layer streams its output to the browser over Server-Sent Events. The frontend is a
dependency-free single-page app (hash router, theme toggle, SSE-over-`fetch`). The backend uses
MemoRizz primitives throughout — `MemAgent`, `Persona`, `EntityMemory`, `KnowledgeBase`,
`Workflow`, `Skillbox`, and `SharedMemory` — the same APIs taught in the notebooks.
